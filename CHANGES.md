# 0.1.0

Tighten dependency to `kaminari ~> 0.16.0` (previously was `kaminari >= 0.16.0`.
This version doesn't work with Kaminari 1.0.0+, and the gemspec should reflect this.
Once the gem has been made compatible with Kaminari 1.0.0+, it will be released as another version.

# 0.0.4

Require cell-4.0.0, cause we can.

# 0.0.3

Require cells and kaminari to make sure all files are available.

# 0.0.2

First officially working version, with kaminari 0.16.x and above!

# 0.0.1

* First release in an unsuspecting world.
